# Real-Time Kanban Board

A modern, real-time collaborative Kanban board built with React, TypeScript, Node.js, and WebSockets.

## 🚀 Features

- **Real-time collaboration** - See changes from other users instantly
- **Drag & drop** - Intuitive card movement with smooth animations
- **Optimistic updates** - Immediate UI feedback with rollback on errors
- **User presence** - See who's online and editing cards
- **Card locking** - Prevent conflicts when multiple users edit
- **Responsive design** - Works on desktop and mobile
- **Type-safe** - Full TypeScript support across the stack

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite + Zustand + dnd-kit
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + Socket.IO + Prisma
- **Database**: SQLite (easily changeable to PostgreSQL/MySQL)
- **Real-time**: WebSocket connections with Socket.IO
- **Monorepo**: pnpm workspaces with shared types

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- pnpm 8+

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd real-time-kanban
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Set up the database:
   ```bash
   cd apps/server
   cp .env.example .env
   pnpm db:migrate
   pnpm db:seed
   ```

4. Start the development servers:
   ```bash
   # From the root directory
   pnpm dev
   ```

This will start:
- Frontend at http://localhost:5173
- Backend at http://localhost:3001
- API at http://localhost:3001/api

### Using the Application

1. Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser
2. Enter the board ID: `sample-board` (created by the seed script)
3. Start moving cards around and see real-time updates!

Try opening multiple browser tabs to see real-time collaboration in action.

## 🧪 Testing the Real-Time Features

1. **Multi-user testing**: Open the app in multiple browser windows/tabs
2. **Card movement**: Drag cards between columns - other windows will update instantly
3. **Card creation**: Add new cards and see them appear for all users
4. **User presence**: See online user count in the board header
5. **Connection status**: Check the connection indicator

## 🔧 Development

## 🚀 Deployment

### Production Deployment (Supabase + Netlify)

This app is configured for easy deployment using:
- **Supabase** for PostgreSQL database and real-time features
- **Netlify** for static hosting and serverless functions

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed deployment instructions.

### Quick Deployment Steps

1. **Set up Supabase**:
   - Create a new project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
   - Run the SQL schema from `DEPLOYMENT.md`
   - Get your connection strings and API keys

2. **Deploy to Netlify**:
   - Connect your GitHub repo to Netlify
   - Set environment variables (Supabase URL and keys)
   - Deploy automatically

3. **Migrate your local setup**:
   ```bash
   # Copy environment files
   cp apps/server/.env.example apps/server/.env
   cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env
   
   # Update with your Supabase credentials
   # Then run the migration script
   node migrate-to-supabase.js
   ```

### Local Development with Supabase

```bash
# After setting up Supabase and updating .env files
pnpm install
node migrate-to-supabase.js
pnpm dev
```

### Docker Deployment (Alternative)

```bash
# Build and start with Docker Compose
docker-compose up --build
```
